# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "We use an output attention mechanism to allocate different weights to different days in terms of their contribution to stock price movement. Thorough empirical studies based upon historical prices of several individual stocks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in stock price prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods"
