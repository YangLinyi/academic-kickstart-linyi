# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "This paper proposes a novel hierarchical, transformer, multi-task architecture designed to harness the text and audio data from quarterly earnings conference calls to predict future price volatility in the short and long term. This includes a comprehensive comparison to a variety of baselines, which demonstrates very significant improvements in prediction accuracy, in the range 17% - 49% compared to the current state-of-the-art.
