I'm a Postdoctoral Associate in the Westlake NLP group, working with Yue Zhang. Previously, I graduated with a PhD from the Insight Centre, University College Dublin, where I worked with Barry Smyth. 

I am broadly interested in the Natural Language Processing in the financial domain, the problem of explainable artificail intelligence (XAI), and improving generalization of neural networks in real natural language understanding.
